# Implementation plan — Amanar as the thin, Pi-first agent-kit

Status: plan · 2026-07-23 · built from `2026-07-23-thin-agent-kit-direction.md`,
then revised after probing the live host interfaces. Pi is the primary harness,
Claude secondary. The deterministic kernel is on `main` (commit `aa9cb6f`,
`workflow/kernel/`, CLI v1.0.0, 44 tests), so its gating dependency is cleared.
Lead workstream is now WS0 — make Pi a first-class, pack-passing host.

**Progress (2026-07-24):** WS0 (Pi first-class host) and WS1 (skill-slimming —
thin `amanar-workflow` adapter + `render_handoff`, `amanar-orchestrate` stub,
`amanar-assure` evidence-citation) complete and committed (`ada2226`, `009b54b`).
Next: WS3 (task-spec + compiler), then WS2.1 (bounded-loop runner — the
evidence-identified reliability mechanism), then WS2.2/2.3 (which need the deferred
sync-skills decisions).

## Current baseline (verified against the tree)

- Kernel: `workflow/kernel/` — contract at `.amanar/workflow.json`, state/receipts
  under `.amanar/run/`, vendored per-repo at `.amanar/kernel/` with pinned
  `VERSION` (`1.0.0`). CLI verbs: `validate`, `begin`, `run-check <id>`,
  `block --reason`, `verify`, `status --json`. Stable exit codes 0/2/3/4/5/6/10.
  Host-independent by construction (ADR-0001) — Pi/Claude/Codex all just invoke it.
- Five skills present, each with `disable-model-invocation: true` (Claude) and
  `agents/openai.yaml` `allow_implicit_invocation: false` (Codex). Pi honors
  neither — see the Pi interface section.
- `amanar-orchestrate/SKILL.md` is still the full 219-line coordinator, not the
  deprecation stub the migration guide targets.
- Behavioral pack: `workflow/tests/run-portability-pack.py` runs the five-task pack
  in `native` and `kernel` modes, grading world-state via `status --json`
  (`verified` + `current`) and receipt count — not transcript. `host_command()`
  builds real invocations only for `codex` and `claude`; **`pi` and `hermes`
  return `None`, so Pi has never run the pack.** ADR-0001 says the release is a
  "Codex pilot unless another already-configured host passes the full pack."
- Gate: `make validate` → harness validator, `validate-workflow.py`, kernel
  unittests, `validate-components.py`, agent-eval `npm test`, synology `uv` tests,
  `git diff --check`.

## Pi interface (probed 2026-07-23, Pi 0.81.1)

Hosts installed: `pi` 0.81.1 (`/opt/homebrew/bin/pi`), `claude` 2.1.218,
`codex` 0.145.0.

- **Headless:** `pi -p "<prompt>" --mode json --no-session --thinking <level>
  --provider <p> --model <m>`. `--no-session` = fresh context per iteration (loop
  runner). `--mode json` = machine-gradable output. `--append-system-prompt <text
  |file>` injects the kernel-controller instruction. `--tools/--exclude-tools/
  --no-tools` bound the blast radius.
- **Repo rules:** Pi auto-discovers `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
  (`--no-context-files` disables). The thin-kit root `AGENTS.md` *is* Pi's
  instruction file — no new file needed (resolves seed item 4).
- **Skills:** Pi reads `~/.agents/skills/` (user) and project `.agents/skills/`;
  `--skill <path>` / `--no-skills` control loading. No per-skill frontmatter gate.
- **Explicit-only on Pi:** enforce structurally — governed and loop invocations use
  `pi --no-skills --skill <path>` to load exactly the intended skill. Interactive
  use stays prose-gated by the description sentence. A Pi extension gate is possible
  (extensions/packages are Pi's hook surface) but deferred.
- **Models:** `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` → `defaultProvider: openai-codex`,
  `defaultModel: gpt-5.6-terra`, `defaultThinkingLevel: medium`. Enabled:
  `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-{terra,sol,luna}`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4-mini`,
  `anthropic-vertex/claude-sonnet-5`, `anthropic-vertex/claude-opus-4-8` (Vertex
  Claude via `npm:@twogiants/pi-anthropic-vertex`). Loop Pi host defaults to
  `gpt-5.6-terra`; Claude-in-Pi is `--provider anthropic-vertex --model claude-…`.

## Cross-harness skill state (probed 2026-07-23)

`~/.agents/` is already the canonical skill hub, so `sync-skills` extends prior
art rather than starting fresh:

- `~/.agents/skills/` = canonical source (Pi reads it natively).
- `~/.agents/scripts/install-codex-skill-links.sh` symlinks each personal skill
  into `~/.codex/skills/`, refuses a whole-directory symlink, guards the
  Codex-managed `.system` dir, and backs up collisions.
- `~/.agents/scripts/sync-agent-core-skills.sh` rsyncs skills/scripts/plugins to a
  remote host over SSH and re-links there.
- `.skill-lock.json` v3 tracks only package-managed community skills; the directory
  is authoritative for locally owned ones.
- **Gaps:** (a) no linker into `~/.claude/skills/`; (b) amanar's `amanar-*` skills
  are not installed into any harness; (c) the personal catalog
  (`orchestrate`/`scaffold`/`codebase-design`/`tdd`/…) predates and overlaps the
  `amanar-*` skills — needs a supersede-or-coexist decision.

## The validator lock

`workflow/tests/validate-workflow.py` hard-codes `EXPECTED` = exactly the five
skill directory names and fails on `actual != EXPECTED`. It also requires per
skill: `disable-model-invocation: true`, a description containing "Use only when
explicitly invoked", `openai.yaml` `allow_implicit_invocation: false`, resolved
`$token`s (allow-list = the five + `amanar-scaffold` + `agent-eval:evaluate-all`),
and resolvable relative markdown links. **Any skill removal, rename, or new
`$token` fails the gate unless the validator changes in the same commit.** New
`references/*.md` are safe.

## Decisions locked (this session)

- Near-term goal: **close Pi gaps first** → WS0 leads.
- Loop runner: **shell out to all host CLIs** (`pi`/`claude`/`codex`), one shared
  invocation module reused by the pack and the runner.
- Resume-digest and RPI task-spec: **deterministic scripts**, kept *outside* the
  frozen kernel CLI (they read `status --json` + receipts) so the 1.0 contract's
  stable-command surface stays fixed.
- Explicit-only on Pi: **structural via `--no-skills --skill <path>`**, not a new
  marker.

## Workstream 0 — Pi first-class enablement (do first)

**0.1 Pi host adapter in the pack.** Add a `pi` branch to
`run-portability-pack.py::host_command()`:
`["pi", "-p", "--no-session", "--mode", "json", "--thinking", "low", "--model",
model, prompt]`, with the kernel-controller instruction via `--append-system-prompt`
and `--provider` defaulting from settings. Factor the host-invocation shapes into a
small shared module so WS2.1 imports the identical Pi/Claude/Codex builders.
Acceptance: `python3 workflow/tests/run-portability-pack.py --host pi --mode both`
reports `accepted=10/10` (5 tasks × native+kernel) or records concrete, non-env
failures. This is a **live run** (real model calls, needs Pi auth) — run it
deliberately, not in `make validate`.

**0.2 Document Pi load paths** in `workflow/README.md`: AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
auto-discovery, skills from `~/.agents/skills` + project `.agents/skills`, the
headless flag set, and the `--no-skills --skill` explicit-only convention.

**0.3 Explicit-only convention** — record the `--no-skills --skill <path>` pattern
where the loop runner and any Pi recipe invoke skills; keep the description
sentence on every skill for interactive use.

Acceptance for WS0: Pi passes the five-task pack (or its failures are understood),
and the Pi interface is documented in-repo.

**WS0 measured (2026-07-23, `workflow/docs/2026-07-23-pi-portability-pack-result.md`):**
8/10 at `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`, thinking low. All 5 native pass; kernel 3/5.
Both kernel misses (task3-recovery, task4-authority) did the substantive work
correctly with passing receipts but stopped at `implementing` — the agent never
issued the final `verify` and mis-invoked the CLI at low effort. A single manual
`verify` took both to `verified`. The kernel and task designs are sound; the gap is
host reliability on the multi-step sequence, which WS1.1 directly targets. Re-measure
after WS1.1.

**WS1.1 done + re-measured (2026-07-24).** Thin adapter, deterministic
`render_handoff.py` (+5 tests, 49 kernel tests green), and `references/handoff.md`
landed; the pack gained a `--effort` parameter. Kernel score: low effort flaky
3–4/5 (missed final `verify`), medium 4/5. The remaining miss is task4-authority,
where explicit "not authorized" framing makes the model `block` a workflow whose own
acceptance is met — an authority-vs-completion judgment case, not a defect (all
failures recover with `begin`/`verify`). Conclusion: single-shot completion is
inherently flaky at low effort; the bounded-loop runner's continue-until-`verified`
retry (WS2.1) is the mechanism that makes it reliable, and the loop is the intended
production path. Evidence:
`workflow/docs/2026-07-23-pi-portability-pack-result.md`.

## Workstream 1 — Skill-slimming onto the kernel

Per `workflow/docs/migrating-to-portable-kernel.md`. Keep skills terse; detail goes
to `references/`.

**1.1 `amanar-workflow` → thin adapter + deterministic resume-digest.** Rewrite the
`SKILL.md` body to route execution through the controller (author
`.amanar/workflow.json`, then `validate → begin → run-check → verify`; a model
statement never substitutes for a receipt). The resume-digest (grafts Track B) is a
**deterministic tool**, not prose: a small script consuming `status --json` +
receipts to emit a handoff — state, current vs stale receipts, an id/artifact
closet from the contract `artifacts`/`scope`, and a checklist-rebuild from remaining
checks. Home it beside the kernel as tooling
(`workflow/kernel/tools/render_handoff.py`), **not** as a new frozen CLI verb; the
SKILL references it. No separate `amanar-handoff` skill (surface creep).

**1.2 `amanar-orchestrate` → one-release deprecation stub.** Replace the 219-line
body with a short stub pointing to host-native scheduling + `$amanar-workflow`;
keep the frontmatter so the validator's five-name set and per-skill checks stay
green. Remove or relocate now-uncited `references/` so no links break. Keep it in
`EXPECTED` this release; removal → four-skill set + validator edit is a later change.

**1.3 `amanar-assure` → split + evidence-citation rule (Graft 1).** Deterministic
completion gates already live in the controller; the SKILL keeps adversarial/review
guidance only. Add after the independence-disclosure sentence: *No evidence, no
verdict. Every finding cites the exact command run and its output. When checking
discrete claims, classify each VERIFIED / CONTRADICTED / UNVERIFIED and pin the
citation to the file:line or command that settles it.* ~6 lines; spill to
`references/evidence.md` if it grows.

**1.4 Keep `amanar-inquire` and `amanar-design`** unchanged except the WS3 task-spec
reference under design.

## Workstream 2 — The three ADDs

Each built on the kernel, each with a `components.yaml` entry, its own `AGENTS.md`,
a validator, and a `make validate` line. None redefines kernel authority, scope,
checks, or receipts (ADR-0001).

**2.1 Bounded-loop runner** — home `workflow/loop/`, component `amanar-workflow-loop`.
Ralph-style: fresh context each iteration (`pi --no-session`, `claude
--no-session-persistence`, `codex --ephemeral`), one kernel task per loop,
`--host {pi,claude,codex}` reusing the WS0.1 shared invocation module. Continue-
condition grades **world-state**: end only when `status --json` returns
`status == "verified"` and `current == true`. Gate on `pass^k` (acceptance holds on
k consecutive independent verifications); bound total iterations. Loop only
mechanical/verifiable work. Validator: unit-test the continue-condition and
iteration bound against a fixture contract with a fake host that reaches `verified`
after N steps — no live model.

**2.2 Backpressure pre-commit hook** — home `harness/backpressure/`, component
`amanar-backpressure`. A thin portable `pre-commit` script that refuses the commit
on non-zero: in a target repo it runs the vendored kernel checks/`verify`; in
Amanar it runs `make validate`. Offered (not forced) by `amanar-scaffold adopt`;
reversible; never touches global git config. Validator: run against passing and
failing fixtures, assert exit 0 / non-zero. Optional agent-eval check wired here
(WS4.2).

**2.3 Cross-harness `sync-skills`** — home `harness/sync-skills/`, component
`amanar-sync-skills`. Portable, versioned, tested superset of the `~/.agents/scripts`
prototypes: link `SKILL.md` sources into Pi (`~/.agents/skills`, native — likely a
no-op if source lives there), Codex (`~/.codex/skills`, reusing the `.system`
guard + backup + symlink-safety of the existing installer), and **Claude
(`~/.claude/skills`, the current gap)**. Opt-in dev tool: `--dry-run` default,
`--apply`, `--remove`; prints every path; never run by `make validate` or a hook
(respects the root AGENTS.md user-config boundary). Validator: run against a temp
`HOME` with `--dry-run` and `--apply`, assert planned == created links and no write
outside the temp dirs.

## Workstream 3 — RPI/QRSPI task-spec (deterministic)

Add `references/task-spec.md` under `amanar-design` (the "Plan" artifact),
cross-referenced from `amanar-workflow`, plus a **compiler**
(`workflow/kernel/tools/compile_task_spec.py`) that turns the template into a
validated `.amanar/workflow.json`
— deterministic, not agent-authored. Field mapping:

- GOAL → `objective`
- DONE-WHEN (exits 0) → `checks[].expectedExit: 0` + `verify`
- SCOPE → `scope` / `exclusions`
- VERIFY → `checks` (`command`/`outputContains`/`minTests`/`testParser`)
- BLAST-RADIUS → `authority.repositoryWrites` / `authority.liveEffects` + `scope`

Reconciles RPI onto existing skills (Research→`inquire`, Plan→`design`,
Implement→`workflow`). No parallel research/plan/implement skills (the validator
lock enforces this anyway).

## Workstream 4 — Reconciliation and hookups

**4.1 Pi instruction-file hookup — resolved.** Pi loads the root `AGENTS.md`
natively; audit it stays < 150 lines. Document the load path in WS0.2. No new file.

**4.2 agent-eval as backpressure/eval gate** (seed item 5). Wire `agent-eval` as an
optional check invoked by the WS2.2 hook and available as the loop's continue-input
for eval-graded tasks. Keep `npm run check` out of `make validate` (git-ignored
artifacts — current Makefile comment stands). Optional: the ADOPT/LIFT/SKIP
quick-mode verdict shape.

**4.3 Attribution.** Handoff and evidence-citation patterns are reimplementations
from `iamneilroberts/claude-skills` (MIT); retain an attribution line in
`references/handoff.md`-equivalent tooling docs and `references/evidence.md`.

## Sequencing

1. **WS0** — Pi adapter in the pack + run it + document the interface. Closes the
   primary Pi gap and turns "Codex pilot" into a measured Pi result.
2. **WS1.3 Graft 1** — cheapest, highest measured value, no dependency.
3. **WS1.1 / WS1.2** — adapter + deterministic resume-digest, orchestrate stub
   (validator stays green; five names persist).
4. **WS3** — task-spec + compiler (unblocks authoring for the loop).
5. **WS2.1 → WS2.2 → WS2.3** — each with its `components.yaml` entry, `AGENTS.md`,
   validator, and `make validate` line added in the same commit.
6. **WS4** hookups + attribution, folded in as referenced pieces land.

Each component change lands with its validator wired into `make validate` in the
same commit, so the gate never goes red between steps.

## Decisions to confirm (defaults chosen; change before implementing)

- **sync-skills ownership**: ship the amanar-versioned tool as the superset and
  retire the `~/.agents/scripts/*.sh` prototypes to it (recommended), vs. just add a
  Claude linker to the existing home scripts and keep amanar out of user-dir tooling.
- **personal-catalog overlap**: the pre-amanar `~/.agents/skills` entries
  (`orchestrate`, `scaffold`, `codebase-design`, `tdd`, …) are superseded by the
  `amanar-*` skills and should be replaced on sync (recommended), vs. coexist under
  distinct names.
- **ADD placement**: loop in `workflow/loop/`; hook and `sync-skills` in `harness/`
  (recommended), vs. all three under `workflow/`.
- **orchestrate**: deprecation stub kept in the validator's five-name set this
  release (recommended), vs. remove now → four-skill validator set.

## Definition of done

- Pi passes the five-task pack (WS0), documented in-repo.
- `make validate` green with three new component validators wired in.
- Five skills: `workflow` = thin controller adapter with a deterministic
  resume-digest tool; `orchestrate` = deprecation stub; `assure` carries the
  evidence-citation rule; `inquire`/`design` intact with the task-spec reference +
  compiler under `design`.
- Loop runner, backpressure hook, and `sync-skills` each exist with an `AGENTS.md`,
  a passing validator, and a `components.yaml` entry.
- No addition exceeds the ROI ceiling: thin config, terse skills, no bespoke
  schemas, no multi-agent orchestration for sequential work. Extend, never rebuild.
